TM Forum Open APIs (Apache 2.0) IoT Agent and Device Component Suite

In addition to including established TM Forum Open APIs, such as alarm management, resource management and activation APIs, the IoT Device Management API Component Suite also includes an IoT Data Access Endpoint API. This API allows for IoT data access using different types of protocols (MQTT IoT, CoAP, etc.). It encapsulates the protocols and allows devices to be easily integrated into solutions that support a host of IoT initiatives, including smart cities, smart factories and other vertical markets.

To access this API; (the Specification, Postman Collection, Swagger file, Reference Implementation, Conformance Profile, and CTK) go to the Open API table at:
